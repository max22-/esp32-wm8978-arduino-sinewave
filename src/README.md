ESP32 TTGO T-Audio sinewave generator
=====================================


This is an example Arduino sketch for the TTGO T-Audio board (an ESP32 based board with a WM8978 audio codec, SD-card, RGB Leds, MPU9250, etc.)
Technical documentation here :
<https://github.com/LilyGO/TTGO-TAudio>

This sketch only generates a sinewave, but it took me quite a long time to make it work.
That's why I share it here, so that you can clone the repo and make so noise straight on :)
It can be useful if you want to start making some sound synthesis in C++, for example.

The code generated by the Faust sawtooth example <https://faust.grame.fr/doc/tutorials/#dsp-on-the-esp32-with-faust> helped me a lot.
The WM8978 driver files come from the Faust project.

Keywords for the lonesome googler who wants to make noise without doing boring i2s stuff :

You can send me an email at <maxime.andre1986@gmail.com> if you want to show what you have done with this tiny piece of code.

The result :
